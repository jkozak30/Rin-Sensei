### *Dungeon Crawler* Game Description
- You are a player within a randomly generated maze, and your goal is to get to the final square marked in green. In the starting square, you will pick your weapon among a sword (melee), axe (melee), and mage staff (ranged). Each square you enter may have an obstacle such as a bullet hell, ghosts that you must kill, or a maze puzzle. Other rooms may have randomly spawned health for you to pick up, or heal you to full health. To win, you must reach the final square and kill the boss, the wall of flesh, which will aim at you with a laser and drop flesh onto you.
- The controls are given at spawn. You can use WASD or arrow keys to move, 'u' to attack, and space to dash.
- If you lose, rerun the game to play again.
